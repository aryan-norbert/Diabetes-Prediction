# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health metrics using machine learning models. It involves preprocessing datasets containing attributes like glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Pandas and NumPy are used for data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: This model is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks such as predicting diabetes.
   - **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method is employed to handle complex relationships and feature interactions in the data, improving prediction accuracy.

3. **Performance Evaluation**: The performance of these models is assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insights into model effectiveness.

### Libraries Used:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Numerical operations and array manipulation.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
